# microgrid_dsm_model
This is a basic version of the micro-grid model to simulate technical and economic performance of micro-grids with demand-side management capabilities.  Implemented in MATLAB, runs on R2016B.  Instructions, description of files, limitations are described herein. 

Note that local memory / computation issues are present when aiming to run with larger number of households (num.consumers > 10) and large state-space (nxm solar/battery combinations >~50) on MacBook Air.
